CAVEATS
1) This app needs internet connection to work currently. My Lists, My Books and My Awards are saved in Core Data for data persistence, however, I did not support offline mode to keep most-recent Overview Books or My List Detail contents in Core Data if the device is offline. This would be the first of steps in future enhancements.

2) I did not use localizable strings, as I didn't feel this app would be too applicable outside of English speakers. Otherwise, I'd have all copy content pulled as dynamic strings and formats from Localizable.Strings.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
1) Offline support (see 1 above)

2) Authenticated sessions can offer users access to each other, supporting a "Borrow" flow. One can offer a recently read book for borrowing, as well as submit a request to borrow.

3) More image support for the books within the app's views, beyond the homepage. Currently, the NYTimes BestSellers API provides imagery only for the Overview call.
